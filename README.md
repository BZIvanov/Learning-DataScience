```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Adding Jupyter as environment variable is not recommended so you can use the Anaconda terminal.

For Windows in the Start menu search `Anaconda PowerShell Prompt`. Navigate to the folder you want and then run `jupyter notebook`. If you want to navigate to the Desktop, you can find it in OneDrive folder in your User folder.
